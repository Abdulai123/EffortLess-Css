# Contribution Guide
Thank you for considering contributing to My CSS Framework! We welcome contributions of all kinds, whether you're a seasoned developer or new to open source.

## How to Contribute
Here are the steps to follow to contribute to My CSS Framework:

### Fork the repository: 
First, create your own copy of the My CSS Framework repository on GitHub by clicking the "Fork" button. This will create a new repository under your own account, which you can then clone to your local machine.

### Create a new branch:
 Next, create a new branch in your fork where you can make your changes. This is important because it allows you to isolate your changes from the main codebase and make it easier for us to review and merge your changes.

### Make your changes:
 Now you're ready to make your changes! You can add new features, fix bugs, or make any other changes you'd like. Just make sure to follow the existing code style and structure, and include appropriate tests to ensure your changes are working as intended.

Submit a pull request: Once you're finished making your changes, it's time to submit a pull request. This is where you can describe your changes and why you think they should be included in the main repository. Be sure to reference any relevant issues and include any relevant tests or documentation.
